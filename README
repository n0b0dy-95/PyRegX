**PyRegX: A Multivariate Regression Plug-in for PyMol**


***PyRegX*** is a GUI-based plugin designed to perform robust ***Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)*** analysis on structured datasets directly from PyMol. Built with Customtkinter, it allows users to load datasets, define regression targets, validate models using statistical metrics, and export results-all without writing code.


**Key Features**

- Load training and test datasets in ***.CSV*** format
- Automatic removal of null-valued columns
- Select dependent (***Y***) variable *via* dialog
- Run multivariate regression using ***statsmodels.OLS***
- **Validate models with**:
  - ***Internal Metrics:*** *R², Adjusted R², MAE, RMSE, VIF, PRESS, SEE*
  - <b><i>External Metrics:</i></b> <i>Q² (f<sub>1</sub>, f<sub>2</sub>), MAE, RMSE</i>
  - ***Cross-Validation:*** Leave-One-Out *Q²* and *MAE*
- **Export**:
  - Statistical summaries (txt)
  - Prediction tables (\_train.csv, \_test.csv)
- **Visualization**:
  - Correlation Heatmap
  - Observed vs Predicted Scatter Plot
- **Easy integration as a PyMol Plug-in** (Menu -> Plugin -> PyRegX gui)

***NOTE: The Index column must be at the first column of the input files.***

**Dependencies**

Ensure the following packages are installed in your Python environment:

- os, sys, subprocess, warnings
- NumPy, Pandas
- Scikit-Learn, statsmodels
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Tkinter
- Customtkinter (for modern GUI components)
- PyMol (for integration)

**Installation**

**Option 1: Install in PyMol environment (manual)**

1. Place the plugin .py file in your PyMol plugins folder (e.g. ~/.pymol/startup/ or via Plugin Manager).
1. Launch PyMol and navigate to **Plugin > Manage > Install** and select the .py file.
1. PyRegX will appear in the **Plugin** menu.

**Option 2: Install required Python dependencies**

If you're not using a pre-configured Python environment, install dependencies with pip:

$ pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn statsmodels matplotlib seaborn customtkinter

**Usage Workflow**

1. **Launch PyRegX GUI** from PyMol:
   *Plugin → PyRegX gui (v0.23)*
1. **Load Training Dataset**
   1. Click *"Load Training Data"* and select a ***.csv*** file
   1. The file must contain both independent and dependent variables
1. **Load Test Dataset**
   1. Click *"Load Test Data"* and select a .csv file with the same structure
1. **Enter Dependent Variable (*Y*)**
   1. Click *"Enter Dependent Column"*
   1. Provide the exact column name to be predicted
1. **Select Output File**
   1. Click *"Select Output File"* to specify where to save results
1. **Run Analysis**
   1. Click *"Run Analysis"*
   1. Generates regression summary, validation metrics, and prediction output
1. **Visual Output**
   1. Correlation heatmap and scatter plot will pop up post-analysis
